Only output the epc configuration file and the enb configuration file in json format. Detailed requirements are:
1. Minimize the configuration as long as it builds up the LTE network properly. Minimize the number of optional items in the generated configuration.
2. The output format should be like the example below. Make sure the response can be directly extracted by json.loads().
example:
```
{"epc.conf", "EPC_CONFIGURATIONS_IN_PLAIN_TEXT", "enb.conf", "ENB_CONFIGURATIONS_IN_PLAIN_TEXT"}
```
3. Do not add any other comments or explanations.
