# RF configuration

dl_earfcn: EARFCN code for DL (only valid if a single cell is configured in rr.conf)
tx_gain: Transmit gain (dB).
rx_gain: Optional receive gain (dB). If disabled, AGC if enabled

Optional parameters:
dl_freq:            Override DL frequency corresponding to dl_earfcn
ul_freq:            Override UL frequency corresponding to dl_earfcn (must be set if dl_freq is set)
device_name:        Device driver family. Supported options: "auto" (uses first driver found), "UHD", "bladeRF", "soapy", "zmq" or "Sidekiq"
device_args:        Arguments for the device driver. Options are "auto" or any string.
                    Default for UHD: "recv_frame_size=9232,send_frame_size=9232"
                    Default for bladeRF: ""
time_adv_nsamples:  Transmission time advance (in number of samples) to compensate for RF delay
                    from antenna to timestamp insertion.
                   Default "auto". B210 USRP: 100 samples, bladeRF: 27
