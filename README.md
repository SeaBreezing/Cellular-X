## Environment & Setup
* We build a practical BS and an associated user equipment (UE) using two USRP X310. Each USRPâ€™s host PC is powered by an AMD Ryzen 1950X processor and the Ubuntu 18.04 operating system.
* Follow [USRP setup tutorial](https://github.com/SeaBreezing/Cellular-X/blob/main/USRP%20setup%20tutorial.md) to build your own cellular network from scratch.
