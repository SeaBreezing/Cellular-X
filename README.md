## Environment & Setup
* We build a practical BS and an associated user equipment (UE) using two USRP X310. Each USRPâ€™s host PC is powered by an AMD Ryzen 1950X processor and the Ubuntu 18.04 operating system.
* Follow [USRP setup tutorial](https://github.com/SeaBreezing/Cellular-X/blob/main/USRP%20setup%20tutorial.md) to prepare your own USRP device on each hostPC from scratch.
* Follow [SRSRAN 4G Installation Guide](https://docs.srsran.com/projects/4g/en/latest/general/source/1_installation.html#gen-installation) to prepare your SRSRAN environment.
* To check your environment, run `srsran`, `srsenb` on hostPC1 and `srsue` on hostPC2. You will see `Network attach successful` as output if your settings are correct.
* Take a third HostPC as a master control for the two hostPCs connecting USRP devices.
